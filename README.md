# UniswapV1

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX). And thus aims to be an alternative to centralised exchanges. It is based on various smart contracts, which enable the exchange of tokens. Currently there are 3 versions of Uniswap. This repo deals with the first version i.e UniswapV1.

UniswapV1 introduced the concept of Automated Market Making (AMM) used Constant Product Market Maker Formula. 

## Architecture Overview:

### Core contracts:

1. Exchange Contract: This is the main contract that facilitates token swaps. Users can exchange one ERC-20 token for another directly through this contract.
2. Factory Contract: This contract is responsible for deploying new Exchange Contracts for each token pair. It serves as a factory for creating new liquidity pools.
3. Token Contract: While Uniswap V1 doesn't have its own token, it interacts with ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can swap any ERC-20 token listed on Uniswap.


Run script:
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Tests can be deployed with:
```bash
`yarn hardhat test`
```

Compile contracts:
```bash
`yarn hardhat compile`
```
